<h1 style="color:black;">The importance of Maya Hieroglyphics</h1>

<p style="color:deeppink;">At last, even though the Maya hieroglyphics is not known around the whole entire world like other stories are.
  In a small village called Todos Santos Cuchumatan Huehuetenango In Guatemala the mayan language is still being talked 
   but not the writing system anymore because spanish has become the main  langaguege  in our small village and because since it not
   know theres no books about it, in a couple of words it has been exctinct but the language called Mam, is still being talked by the Mayas
   so one of my goals when I grow up I will study more about it and hopefully make it known again to the whole world because like any other language and writing, 
   it is also important to the people who speak it and to others who wish to learn it.
