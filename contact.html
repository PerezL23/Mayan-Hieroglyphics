  <h1 style="color:black;">Hieroglyphics Maya History </h1>
   <p style="color:purple;">The people who created the Maya hieroglyphics were the Mayas. Mayas have been living in San Bartolo, Guatemala in the 3rd BCE centuary. Back then the Mayas didn't have an alphabet like we have today. Their way to 
 communicate was through signs and  symbols and their writing system the hieroglyphics. They had 800 glyphs or signs and around 1,000 symbols. Each word represented a word or sound. And their numbers? Mayas only used 3 symbols to make a number: a dot representing a value of one, a bar representing five, and a shell representing zero.
